# idea

Now after a few years since I created _PhishMailer_ I've decided that its time for a version 2.
However this time it will not be CLI based but instead it will provide a web interface, for two main reasons
 - Easier User Experience
 - I wanted to create something webbased

its still in the early stages however a "prototype" for the interface was created


## OverView
Compared to the first version of phishmailer this will have a few upgrades:
 - GUI not cli
 - More templates
 - email spoofing
 - create Targets for easier tracking
 - email open checker
 - mass sender not just spearphishing
 - host phishing pages directly, no need for external
 - create "campaigns"
